### Monthly Gross Rent Data from IPUMS

Current time period: change from 2004 to 2024

https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/RENTGRS#description_section

"RENTGRS reports the gross monthly rental cost of the housing unit, including contract rent plus additional costs for utilities (water, electricity, gas) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). The census PUMS for each year constructed this variable by adding the amounts reported for contract rent, utility costs, and fuel costs. RENTGRS amounts should be more comparable across renting households than RENT (Contract rent) amounts, which may or may not include utilities and fuels. See RENT for more discussion of contract rent.

Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors). The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

Inflation-adjusted versions of this variable created with the Adjust Monetary Values tool will use the census/survey year (i.e., YEAR) as the reference year."

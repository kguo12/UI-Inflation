**Replacement Rates**

"The Replacement Rate is the ratio of the claimants' weekly benefit amount (WBA) to the claimants' average weekly wage. Two Replacement Ratios are published:

Replacement Ratio 1 = Weighted Average of: WBA / (Normal Hourly Wage x 40 Hrs.)
Replacement Ratio 2 = Ratio of: Weighted Average WBA / Weighted Average (Normal Hourly Wage x 40 Hrs.)
Weekly wage is based on hourly wage of usual job of claimant, normalized to a 40-hour work week and may not equal the claimant's actual average weekly wage.

The UI replacement rate covers the four-quarter moving average ending with selected quarter-ending date."

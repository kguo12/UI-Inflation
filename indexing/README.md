**Automatic Adjustments to Weekly Benefit Amounts**
"Many states link their maximum weekly benefit amount with the state’s average weekly wage, thus providing for an automatic adjustment as overall wages change across time. The maximum weekly benefit amount is usually indexed to be more than 50 percent of the average weekly wage in covered employment within the state during a recent 1-year period. The minimum weekly benefit amount is specified in the law in most states. However, some state laws link the minimum weekly benefit amount with the states’ average weekly wage as well."

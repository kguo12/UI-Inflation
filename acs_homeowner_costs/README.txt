Selected Monthly Owner Costs
The data on selected monthly owner costs were obtained from Housing Questions 14, 16, and Questions 20 through 24 in the 2024 American Community Survey (ACS). 
The data were obtained for owner-occupied units. Selected monthly owner costs are the sum of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property (including payments for the first mortgage, second mortgages, home equity loans, and other junior mortgages); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property; utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer); and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). It also includes, where appropriate, the monthly homeowners association (HOA) fee and/or condominium fee (Question 16) and mobile home costs (Question 24) (personal property taxes, site rent, registration fees, and license fees). Selected monthly owner costs were tabulated for all owner-occupied units, and usually are shown separately for units “with a mortgage” and for units “not mortgaged.”
Selected monthly owner costs provide information on the monthly housing cost expenses for owners. When the data is used in conjunction with income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels.

Adjusting Selected Monthly Owner Costs for Inflation – To inflate selected monthly owner costs from previous years, the dollar values are inflated to the latest year’s dollar values by multiplying by a factor equal to the average annual Consumer Price Index (CPI-URS-All items) factor for the current year and dividing by the average annual CPI-U-RS-All items factor for the earlier/earliest year.

Median Selected Monthly Owner Costs – This measure divides the selected monthly owner costs distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median selected monthly owner costs and one-half above the median. Medians are shown separately for units “with a mortgage” and for units “not mortgaged.” Median selected monthly owner costs are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A.) Median selected monthly owner costs are rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

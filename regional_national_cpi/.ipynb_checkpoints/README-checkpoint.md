## Regional CPI Indicies

Taken from BLS https://www.bls.gov/cpi/regional-resources.htm, base period 1982-1984 = 100.
- Use Regional CPI-U for **within-state** inflation. Measuring **changes** in real value benefits across states. Do not use for adequacy comparisons between states.
    - Real UI benefits are defined relative to each state’s regional CPI-U, so estimated changes reflect purchasing power **relative to local inflation** rather than cross-state price level differences.
- Use National CPI-U for general deflating. Allows for adequacy comparisons between states. Robustness checks.
    - How real UI values change **relative to national inflation**.

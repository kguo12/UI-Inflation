### HUD Income Limits

Data Source (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html)

"The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sets income limits that determine eligibility for assisted housing programs including the Public Housing, Section 8 project-based, Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher, Section 202 housing for the elderly, and Section 811 housing for persons with disabilities programs. HUD develops income limits based on Median Family Income estimates and Fair Market Rent area definitions for each metropolitan area, parts of some metropolitan areas, and each non-metropolitan county."

For 4 person household, calculations are as follows (MFI - median family income)
VLIL - 50% of MFI
ELIL - 30% of MFI
LIL - 80% of MFI
